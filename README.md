# Breakout/ Arkanoid

Breakout was the first game I ever coded. It was on a ZX Spectrum using BASIC from a book ...

It looked a bit like the image below but the bricks were all the same colour - brick colour ... I remember all the time it took to type in the code being absolutely worth it - my friends and I were "blown away" by it! :roll_eyes:. Sad now I know but the game was seriously addictive in that old skool, blindly-repetitive, this is rubbish so why can't I stop playing it, sort of way!! It's amazing what you can do with 48K of RAM!

Arkanoid is the modern version of Breakout .. This version is written in Typescript. There are many versions of Arkanoid, with 'Arkanoid - Eternal Battle' ([released Oct 27, 2022 on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1717270/Arkanoid__Eternal_Battle/)) being the latest. The version here is more akin to the simpler initial version of Arkanoid and is really just a fun way of practicing Typescipt concepts!! So, ... no complaints if it's not 100% polished or missing your favourite features!! :wink:
